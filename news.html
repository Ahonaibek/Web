						Sony slides on Microsoft-Activision Blizzard tie-up plan
					</h1>
					<p>
						The deal worth $68.7bn (£50.5bn), would be Microsoft's biggest ever buyout and the largest deal in gaming history.

						It would see the US firm owning popular gaming franchises including Call of Duty, Warcraft and Overwatch.

						The deal would be a major step for Microsoft's Xbox gaming brand in its battle against Sony's PlayStation.

						It also comes a year after Microsoft bought another influential gaming company, Bethesda for $7.5bn.

						Buying the troubled but successful Activision would turn Microsoft into the world's third-biggest gaming company by revenue, behind China's Tencent and Sony, marking a major shift for the industry.

						Microsoft said the Activision-Blizzard deal would help it grow its gaming business across mobile, PC and consoles as well as providing the building blocks for the metaverse.

						The purchase of the Call of Duty maker comes as Microsoft is also aggressively expanding its Game Pass subscription service.

						"We're investing deeply in world-class content, community and the cloud to usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all," Microsoft's chief executive Satya Nadella said in a statement.

					<h1> Tesla stock jumps after reporting record vehicle deliveries for 2021</h1>
					<p>
						Shares of Tesla continued to jump on Monday, a day after the electric vehicle maker beat fourth-quarter and full-year delivery expectations.

						The stock closed up 13%.

						Tesla delivered 308,600 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, the company delivered 936,172 vehicles, marking an 87% rise year over year. Wall Street analysts had expected Tesla deliveries of 267,000 in the fourth quarter and 897,000 for all of 2021, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet.

						Investors rallied around the stock, as deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by the company. Tesla will announce earnings for last quarter in the coming weeks.

						Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he wants to increase the company’s vehicle sales volume to 20 million annually over the next nine years. As part of that effort, Tesla is set to start production of the Model Y crossover at its new factory in Austin, Texas, this year. It aims to open another factory in Brandenburg, Germany, after that.

					<h1> Meta faces billion-pound class-action case</h1>
					<p>
						Up to 44 million UK Facebook users could share £2.3bn in damages, according to a competition expert intending to sue parent company Meta.

						Dr Liza Lovdahl Gormsen alleges Meta "abused its market dominance" to set an "unfair price" for free use of Facebook - UK users' personal data.

						She intends to bring the case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

						A Meta representative said users had "meaningful control" of what information they shared.

						'Excessive profits'
						Facebook "abused its market dominance to impose unfair terms and conditions on ordinary Britons, giving it the power to exploit their personal data", Dr Lovdahl Gormsen says.

						And this data, harvested between 2015 and 2019, provided a highly detailed picture of their internet use, helping the company make "excessive profits".

						Anyone living in the UK who used Facebook at least once during the period will be part of the claim unless they choose to opt out, she says.

						However, in November, the UK's Supreme Court rejected an optout claim seeking billions of pounds in damages from Google over alleged illegal tracking of millions of iPhones - Google said the issue had been addressed a decade ago.

						Free services
						The judge in that case said the claimant had failed to prove damage had been caused to each individual by the data collection.

						But he did not rule out the possibility of future mass-action cases if damages could be calculated.

						And Dr Lovdahl Gormsen told BBC News: "Optout cases are specifically permitted at the Competition Appeal Tribunal.

						"As a result, my case is able to claim damages on behalf of the 44 million British Facebook users affected."

						Meta has rejected the allegations.

						People use its free services because they find them useful and have control over how their data us used, it says.

						'Deliver value'
						A representative told BBC News: "People access our service for free.

						"They choose our services because we deliver value for them and they have meaningful control of what information they share on Meta's platforms and who with.

						"We have invested heavily to create tools that allow them to do so."

						However, this latest case adds to the company's legal battles

						The US Federal Trade Commission was recently given the go-ahead to take Meta to court over anti-trust rules.

						Meta said it was sure it would prevail in court.

						Mobile firms agree another 5G delay at US airports
					</h1>
					<p>
						US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the rollout of their new 5G service at some airports.

						The C-band service, which offers faster speeds and broader coverage, was due to be turned on tomorrow.

						But airlines in the US have pushed to delay the start, warning that the signals could interfere with aeroplane navigation systems.

						The telecoms firms expressed frustration as they bowed to pressure to limit their rollout.

						AT&T said it was "temporarily" deferring the rollout at a "limited number of towers around certain airport runways". Regulators had had "two years" to plan for the start of 5G service, it added.

						"We are frustrated by the Federal Aviation Administration's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner," AT&T said in a statement.

						Gloucester Council cyber attack linked to Russian hackers
					</h1>
					<p>
						A cyber attack which has knocked out parts of a council website has been linked to the work of Russian hackers.

						Gloucester City Council became aware that its IT systems had been affected on 20 December last year.

						Since then, the council's online revenue and benefits, planning and customer services have been affected.

						The council has been working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to understand more about the attack.

						Gloucester City Council said its sources, who do not wish to be named, allege the cyber attack was carried out by hackers from Russia.

						According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the malware made its way into the local authority's system embedded in an email which had been sent to a council officer.

						The harmful software, known as sleeper malware, is understood to have been dormant for some time before it was activated.

						Other local authorities and government agencies are currently blocking the council's emails.

						Online application forms used to claim for housing benefit, council tax support, test and trace support payments, discretionary housing payments and several other services have been delayed or are unavailable.

						Residents have been asked to contact the council via email instead.

						Apple removes Wordle clones from App Store
					</h1>
					<p>
						Multiple copycat versions of the hugely popular word game Wordle have been removed from the App Store, Apple has confirmed to BBC News.

						BBC News found several similar-looking games still available, however. A different game with the same name has been on the store for five years.

						On Google Play, the equivalent for Android phones, there were two games called Wordle but neither was similar.

						The name is not believed to be trademarked or the design copyrighted.

						Wordle challenges players to find a five-letter word in six guesses, with a new puzzle published every day.

						It is available through a free website - but has no smartphone app.

						Players begin by guessing any five-letter word.

						If any of the letters are in that day's word but in the wrong place, they turn gold
						If they are in the word in the right place, they turn green
						If they are not in the word, they turn grey
						Players can post how quickly they solved the colourful grid on social media - but in a way that does not spoil the answer for those still playing.

						And this feature has helped propel the game from 90 users in November to more than two million, according to some estimates.
