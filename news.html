					<h1> TikTok launches plan to fight Holocaust denial</h1>
					<p>
						TikTok has rolled out new measures to combat Holocaust denial on its platform in partnership with Unesco and the World Jewish Congress (WJC).

                         Users who search for terms relating to the Holocaust will be directed towards accurate information.

                         A total of 17% of content related to the Holocaust on the viral video app either denied or distorted events, Unesco said.

                        TikTok said it put its "full strength" into removing hate.

                         Speaking on Holocaust Memorial Day, TikTok said that when people search for a term related to the Holocaust, they will now see a banner at the top of the results page that prompts them to visit a WJC and Unesco website aboutholocaust.org to learn more.

                        Users will also be pointed to the website if they look up hashtags like #HolocaustSurvivor or #HolocaustRemembrance

					<h1> Nvidia may abandon its $40B ARM acquisition</h1>
					<p> 
						Nvidia has reportedly told partners it doesn’t expect the acquisition to go ahead. That said, both Nvidia and SoftBank appear to be pressing forward with the deal for the time being; Nvidia stands to lose $1.25 billion if it fails.If the acquisition does fall through, SoftBank may instead issue an IPO of Arm shares — though both Arm and SoftBank argue that the company will be too weak to compete without major financial support. 

						Nvidia has been attempting to purchase Arm at a cost of around $40 billion, but the plan has upset regulators worldwide.  They are concerned that the purchase puts Nvidia in position to harm competitors and hinder future technology development.
						
						
						The UK Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) noted the importance of Arm to many in the industry, and warned that the merger would, “create incentives to change Arm’s business model and favor Nvidia.”
						
						While Arm is UK-based, the UK isn’t the only nation to investigate the deal, which has also fallen afoul of regulators in Europe and has the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) suing to prevent it from taking place.

					<h1>Mobile firms agree another 5G delay at US airports</h1>
					<p>
						US mobile networks AT&T and Verizon have agreed to postpone the rollout of their new 5G service at some airports.

						The C-band service, which offers faster speeds and broader coverage, was due to be turned on tomorrow.

						But airlines in the US have pushed to delay the start, warning that the signals could interfere with aeroplane navigation systems.

						The telecoms firms expressed frustration as they bowed to pressure to limit their rollout.

						AT&T said it was "temporarily" deferring the rollout at a "limited number of towers around certain airport runways". Regulators had had "two years" to plan for the start of 5G service, it added.

						"We are frustrated by the Federal Aviation Administration's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it do so in a timely manner," AT&T said in a statement.

					<h1>Gloucester Council cyber attack linked to Russian hackers</h1>
					<p>
						A cyber attack which has knocked out parts of a council website has been linked to the work of Russian hackers.

						Gloucester City Council became aware that its IT systems had been affected on 20 December last year.

						Since then, the council's online revenue and benefits, planning and customer services have been affected.

						The council has been working with the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre to understand more about the attack.

						Gloucester City Council said its sources, who do not wish to be named, allege the cyber attack was carried out by hackers from Russia.

						According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the malware made its way into the local authority's system embedded in an email which had been sent to a council officer.

						The harmful software, known as sleeper malware, is understood to have been dormant for some time before it was activated.

					<h1>Apple removes Wordle clones from App Store</h1>
					<p>
						Multiple copycat versions of the hugely popular word game Wordle have been removed from the App Store, Apple has confirmed to BBC News.

						BBC News found several similar-looking games still available, however. A different game with the same name has been on the store for five years.

						On Google Play, the equivalent for Android phones, there were two games called Wordle but neither was similar.

						The name is not believed to be trademarked or the design copyrighted.

						Wordle challenges players to find a five-letter word in six guesses, with a new puzzle published every day.

						It is available through a free website - but has no smartphone app.

						Players begin by guessing any five-letter word.

						If any of the letters are in that day's word but in the wrong place, they turn gold
						If they are in the word in the right place, they turn green
						If they are not in the word, they turn grey
						Players can post how quickly they solved the colourful grid on social media - but in a way that does not spoil the answer for those still playing.
